You need to create:

first_clause: A sentence that must contain the idiom exactly. Use "because" as a connector to continue the sentence after the idiom. Important: This sentence must not include any additional words that hint at whether the idiom is used figuratively or literally.
Two completions for that sentence:
figurative_word: A single word that shows the idiom is being used in its figurative sense.
literal_word: A single word that shows the idiom is being used in its literal sense.

Here are examples of valid outputs: 

{
  "idiom": "kick the bucket",
  "first_clause": "He would kick the bucket because he was",
  "figurative_word": "old",
  "literal_word": "mad"
}

{
  "idiom": "spill the beans",
  "first_clause": "She spilled the beans because she was",
  "figurative_word": "nervous",
  "literal_word": "clumsy"
}

Task Summary:

Input: An idiom
Output: A JSON array where each object includes idiom, a sentence (first_clause) that must contain the idiom exactly (without revealing its figurative meaning) followed by "because", and two single-word completions: one to indicate a figurative interpretation and one to indicate a literal interpretation.
Important: The first_clause must contain the idiom exactly, without any hints that reveal whether the idiom is being used figuratively or literally. The second part of the sentence should be only a single word indicating the intended meaning.
