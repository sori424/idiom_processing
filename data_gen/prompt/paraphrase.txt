You need to create:

For a given list of idioms and an associated sentence (original_sentence) that uses the idiom, generate two paraphrased versions of the sentence:
figurative_sentence: Rewrite the original_sentence by replacing the idiom with its actual figurative meaning. 
literal_sentence: Rewrite the original_sentence by interpreting the idiom literally, leading to a misunderstanding of its meaning. Important: Do not use the words "physically" or "literally" in the sentence. 

For example, for the idiom "kick the bucket", if the original_sentence is "He would kick the bucket because he was", a valid output would be:

{
  "idiom": "kick the bucket",
  "original_sentence": "He would kick the bucket because he was",
  "figurative_sentence": "He would die because he was",
  "literal_sentence": "He would kick the container because he was"
}

Task Summary:

Input: An idiom and original_sentence that uses the idiom (without revealing whether it is figurative or literal)
Output: A JSON array where each object includes idiom, a sentence (original_sentence) that uses the idiom (without revealing its figurative meaning), and two paraphrased sentences: one to indicate a figurative interpretation of the idiom and one to indicate a literal misinterpretation of the idiom.
